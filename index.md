## Professional Experience

### __Fire Area Detection based on CNN network__ `2017.9 - 2018.3`
- Construct a CNN network to detect the fire area on the image.
- Use slide window to extract sample and do classification for each region of the original image.
- Use cross-entropy as the loss function and implement A* algorithm on the constructed map.

### __Updated A* algorithm with box blur method__ `2017.4 - 2017.6`
- Use a external weight value to respresent different terrains on the map.
- Update cost function f=g+h to f=g+h+w
- Apply box blur method to reculate weight value for each node inside the map and simulate the algorithm on unity3D.

### __Prediction of Presidential Election by Bayes classifier using GDP per cipita__  `2017.6 - 2017.9`
- Realized a bayse classifier by python
- From the election information and GDP information gather from Internet, calculate the piror probability for each state's vote.
- From maximum likelihood theory, calculate the posterior probability by GDP per ciptia
- According to the bayse formula, calculate the vote probability of each state.

### __Smart flowerpot based on Raspberry Pi__ `2016.4 - 2016.9`
- Adapted temperature sensor,humidity sensor and luminance sensor on the Raspberry and gather data from environment.
- Upload the data to could platform every 1 hour, and with a Android App, user can monitor these data in real time.
- With the Android app, user can send task to the flowerport, such as water and take pictures.
- Also, with the android app, we will push the gardening kownledges to the user.
